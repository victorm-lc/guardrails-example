# LangGraph Guardrails Example Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a comprehensive, easy-to-understand example showing how to add guardrails to LangGraph applications using the entire LangChain ecosystem (LangSmith, LangGraph, LangGraph Platform).

## Project Structure

### 1. Custom LangGraph Implementation (`custom_agent.py`)
- Build a custom multi-agent workflow with built-in guardrails
- Include input validation, output filtering, and safety checks
- Demonstrate state management with guardrails
- Show how to integrate guardrails into graph nodes

### 2. Prebuilt Agent Implementation (`prebuilt_agent.py`)
- Use `create_react_agent` with post-model hooks for guardrails
- Show how to add validation and safety checks to existing agents
- Implement both pre and post-model hooks (v2 API)
- Demonstrate seamless integration with existing workflows

### 3. Guardrails Implementations (`guardrails/`)
- **`content_filter.py`**: Content safety and toxicity filtering
- **`output_validator.py`**: Structure and format validation
- **`compliance_checker.py`**: Business rule compliance
- **`human_review.py`**: Human-in-the-loop workflows
- **`__init__.py`**: Module initialization and common utilities

### 4. Configuration & Setup
- Update `pyproject.toml` with additional dependencies
- Create `.env.example` for API keys and configuration
- Add `langgraph.json` for LangGraph Platform deployment
- Create comprehensive `README.md` with usage examples

### 5. Examples & Tests (`examples/`)
- Practical use case demonstrations
- Different types of guardrails in action
- Integration with various LLM providers
- Demonstration scripts showing different guardrail types

## Key Features to Implement

### Input Guardrails
- Validate and sanitize user inputs
- Check for harmful content before processing
- Format validation and normalization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Output Guardrails
- Filter and validate LLM responses
- Ensure appropriate content generation
- Format and structure validation
- Bias detection and mitigation

### Safety Checks
- Content moderation and toxicity detection
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) filtering
- Harmful instruction detection
- Compliance with content policies

### Business Rules
- Custom validation logic specific to use cases
- Industry-specific compliance checks
- Data governance and privacy rules
- Quality assurance metrics

### Human-in-the-Loop
- Approval workflows for sensitive operations
- Review queues for flagged content
- Escalation mechanisms
- Feedback collection and learning

### LangSmith Integration
- Tracing and monitoring guardrails performance
- Logging guardrail decisions and outcomes
- Performance metrics and analytics
- Debugging and troubleshooting tools

### Error Handling
- Graceful failure and retry mechanisms
- Fallback strategies when guardrails fail
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery and continuation patterns

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies to Add
- `guardrails-ai`: For advanced validation capabilities
- `langchain-community`: For additional integrations
- `python-dotenv`: Environment configuration
- `openai`: For LLM integration
- Additional validators and tools as needed

### Architecture Patterns
- **Middleware Pattern**: Guardrails as middleware layers
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Multiple guardrails in sequence
- **Observer Pattern**: Monitoring and logging guardrail actions
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different guardrail strategies based on context

### Integration Points
- **Pre-processing**: Input validation and sanitization
- **In-processing**: Real-time monitoring during LLM calls
- **Post-processing**: Output validation and filtering
- **Async processing**: Background validation and monitoring

### Deployment Considerations
- LangGraph Platform compatibility
- Docker containerization
- Environment-specific configurations
- Scaling and performance optimization

## Success Criteria
- Clear, well-documented examples that developers can easily understand
- Production-ready code that can be adapted for real applications
- Comprehensive coverage of different guardrail types
- Integration with the full LangChain ecosystem
- Easy setup and configuration process
- Robust error handling and monitoring capabilities

## Timeline
1. **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure and basic guardrails
2. **Phase 2**: Advanced features and integrations
3. **Phase 3**: Examples, documentation, and testing
4. **Phase 4**: Deployment configuration and final polish
